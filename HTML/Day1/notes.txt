Web Application : These are the applications that which are to be called from various places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications, then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

(i) Scripting Langauges 

(ii) Programming Languages 

What is the difference between scripting langauges and programming languages : 

1) Scripting Languages are langauges, that which are interpreted directly, so during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

HTML, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, CSS3 etc...

2) Programming langauges are langauges that which are compiled first, so during runtime they takes very less time to execute. 

Dotnet, Java, Python etc...


What is Client-Side Scripting 

What is Server-Side Scripting

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 

Used to create any sample web pages. 

We can define all the elements using tags. 

To start with html, 

<html>
</html> : To start with HTML, we need to add the elements inside that tag. 

<head>
</head> : Contains the global information about entire web page like stylesheet, javscript code, heading files etc...

<title> </title> : displays heading on title bar. 

<body> 
</body> : Contains actual content for the given page. 

Actual HTML Structure is : 
__________________________

<html>
  <head> ......
	....
	...
  </head>
<title> Sample Title</title>
<body>
...
...
</body>
</html>

<p> Used to start new paragraph </p>

Anchor tag : If you want to link one page to another page, then we need the help of anchor tag. 

Syntax : 

<a href="targetPage">Display Text</a>
